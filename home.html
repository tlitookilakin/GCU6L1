            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>
                In the last two years I've picked up art as a hobby and it's been a lot of fun. Mostly I draw characters of my own creation- many of them
                my player characters for tabletop rpgs that I play with my friends. I tend to favor animals over humans, in particular dragons, ponies, 
                cats, and wolves. I usually sketch them with paper, pencil, and ink, then trace and color them digitally. In the past I've also done
                fully-digital vector-based artwork.
            </p>
            <h3>Modding Games</h3>
            <p>
                I've been modding games for a while, but I've only been doing c# modding for about 3 years. I mod Stardew Valley almost exclusively, usually
                to make things that I want to use myself. It's a lot of fun to tinker with Harmony, and transpilers in particular make me feel like a 
                wizard. The mod I am most proud of is probably <a href="portfolio.html#HHD">Happy Home Designer</a>.

            <h3>Favorite Books</h3>
            <h4>The Locked Tomb</h4>
            <p>
                The Locked Tomb is actually a series- originally, it was meant to be a trilogy, but is now on its fourth book. It's an alternate future sci-fi 
                setting, where the protagonists and antagonists are both necromancers, ruled by a man who has assumed the mantle of God. It's a mishmash of
                several different genres, the only really good person has been dead a thousand years, and the protagonists are in the World's Worst Lesbian 
                Situationship.
            </p>
            <h4>Through the Well of Pirenne</h4>
            <p>
                This one's fan fiction, but it's good enough that I bought a print copy. It's an incredible adventure, with lots of fresh ideas 
                and a mixture of several different flavors of mysticism and mythology. A disillusioned teen enters a magical land she thought she'd 
                only invented in a desperate bid to find and rescue her kidnapped kid sister before she's changed forever.
            </p>
            <h4>Middlegame</h4>
            <p>
                Despite being a relatively short standalone novel, Middlegame has so many thematic layers to it that I could write an essay unraveling them. 
                It's a story about alchemy, familial conflict, growing up, and stories themselves. It's rich, complex, and non-linear, with a breathtaking finale.
