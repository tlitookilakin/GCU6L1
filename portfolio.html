                The purpose of this project was to provide an interactive command line tool to convert sentences to pig latin. 
                The initial implementations were fairly basic, but increased in complexity to meet several of the challenge
                objectives, as well as my own personal design challenge. To improve efficiency, I wanted to create a single-loop 
                solution that simultaneously parsed the input text and produced the output text. I succeeded by writing a state 
                machine to transform the input sequence.

                    The purpose of this project was to work with a group to produce a point-of-sale system for a cafe. 
                    I collaborated with two other programmers, and the end result has several features of note. First off, it
                    supports adding new items freely. It also tracks inventory, saving and loading from a standard .tsv file.
                    All items, including custom-added ones, are dynamically grouped into categories. When selecting items
                    for purchase, it allows selecting by either name or menu item number based on user input. It also appropriately
                    handles various payment methods, including validation for credit cards.

                    This personal passion project is a mod for Stardew Valley. It completely replaces the interface for the furniture catalogue
                    with the aim of increasing usability. It comes with many quality-of-life changes, most notably the ability to place
                    furniture directly from the catalogue, and direct integration with another popular Stardew Valley mod. It also
                    provides ways for other mods to easily integrate with it, without tightly coupling them. My favorite aspect of this 
                    project was using a <a href="https://harmony.pardeike.net/index.html">Harmony</a>
                    <a href="https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/reverse-patching.html#changing-the-content-of-the-original">
                        reverse patch transpiler</a> to bridge functionality with another mod.
